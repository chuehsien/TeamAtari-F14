Rules:

1. all modules have inputs declared first, followed by inouts, followed by outputs. Each type is declared on separate lines.
	
2. all module instantiation using the follow style <module> <instancename>(.blah1(input name1), .blah2(input name2) ....)
3. assert low variables go by <varname>_L. assert high variables have no '_H' appended to them.
